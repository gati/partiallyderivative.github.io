We learn that [millennials are staying married
longer](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/04/marriage-divorce-figures-ons-comparison-decades-noughties),
you can go really deep down the [Star Wars rabbit
hole](http://www.sciencealert.com/data-scientists-map-every-important-character-in-the-star-wars-universe),
and all [your so-called allergies were made up by your
parents](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3056860/most-school-kids-who-report-food-allergies-dont-have-them).
Also we talk to epidemiologist [Eric
Lofgren](https://twitter.com/germsandnumbers) about how humanity can
survive the zombie apocalypse.Â
