This week we explore the future of artificial intelligence by discussing
[robot
sex](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/artificial-intelligence-humans-computers)
at length. Chris seems pretty into it, not that we're judging. Also
[Minecraft for AI](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35778288)
experiments and [humanity's epic
triumph](https://github.com/yenchenlin1994/DeepLearningFlappyBird) over
the most obnoxious iPhone game ever created.

In this week's outlier, [Manuel Ebert](https://twitter.com/@maebert) of
[Summer.ai](http://summer.ai/) tells us how he uses spreadsheets to
track his sex life. We recorded the story back in September at a live
recording we did with [Sean Taylor](http://seanjtaylor.com/) at
[Geekdom](http://geekdomsf.com/) in San Francisco. Of course huge thanks
to Geekdom for having us! We'll release the rest of that episode soon!
