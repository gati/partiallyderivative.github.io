We're back! The latest nerdy data news, some beer, and a look how open
data is used to fight crime and corruption. Jonathon is drinking [Austin
Eastciders](http://austineastciders.com/cider/), Chris is drinking a
[Nitro IPA](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/209/191070/), and
we're talking about [corporate big brother sucking up your work
data](http://fortune.com/2016/02/17/castlight-pregnancy-data/), plus
Miguel Garrido's [epic, data-driven quest to find a parking
space](http://blog.manugarri.com/where-the-f-can-i-park/) in Murica,
Spain. We also interview [Eliot
Higgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Higgins), founder of
[Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/), about his team's amazing
techniques for tracking global conflict that rival national intelligence
agencies.
