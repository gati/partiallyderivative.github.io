The data of colliding atoms, baby universes and the foundation of our
existence. We talk with internationally renowned researchers [Dr. Kyle
Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Cranmer), one of
experimental particle physicists responsible for discovering the elusive
[Higgs Boson](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson), and [Dr. Lee
Smolin](http://leesmolin.com/), one of the theoretical physicists behind
[Loop quantum
gravity](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/string-theory-and-loop-quantum-gravity.html),
and author of [The Trouble With
Physics](http://leesmolin.com/writings/the-trouble-with-physics/), and
[Time
Reborn](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Reborn-Crisis-Physics-Universe/dp/0544245598).Â 

This episode doesn't get too technical (we're not physicists after all),
but it'll still blow your freakin' mind.
